Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

## Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)

I looked at the CISCO Collaboration Certificate, I found it can be very helpful on your resume to show that you are a good team player and can really 
help with brainstorming ans group work

## College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)
* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

For most co-ops and internships they require you to be in the middle of some sort of assocites or bachelors degree and temawork skills

## Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.
I looked at cdcc and it would look really good on a resume, because it has won many different awards, and It teraches teamwork
